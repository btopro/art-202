![](/assets/F_1.jpg)
**Ex 1**
Lets start the knight out with a cube

![](/assets/F_2.jpg)
**Ex 2**
Use **loop-cuts** or **subdivide** the space

![](/assets/F_3.jpg)
**Ex 3**
**Split and delete half of the face** through so that we can **mirror** and just work **one side for now**

![](/assets/F_4.jpg)
**Ex 4**
Adhere geometry to the form while keeping track of front-versus-back-geometry and reference images

![](/assets/F_5.jpg)
**Ex 5a**
Insert additional **loop-cuts,** with restraint, when needed

![](/assets/F_5b.jpg)
**Ex 5b**
Use **few**, but **strategic loop-cuts,** **cross-referencing multiple angles for accuracy**

![](/assets/F_6.jpg)
**Ex 6**
Gradually, by **going back and forth between views** the reference points will start to imply the rest of the way to completing the form

![](/assets/F_7.jpg)
**Ex 7**
Concentrate on getting the implied core of the reference images before chiseling further in

![](/assets/F_8.jpg)
**Ex 8**
I am **not satisfied** with this approach, so I am going to start over using a **slightly different method
**
![](/assets/F_9.jpg)
**Ex 9**
I remember this step

![](/assets/F_10.jpg)
**Ex 10**
This time let's **start with the base**

![](/assets/F_11.jpg)
**Ex 11**
**Using a combination of extrude and shrink or fatten we can develop an intuitive structure from the ground-up**

![](/assets/F_12.jpg)
**Ex 12**
Try to capture the **essence of the geometric form** with the f**ewest number** of **most-consistently-sized polygons**

![](/assets/F_13.jpg)
**Ex 13**
Move around the form and before you know it it will start to come together

![](/assets/F_14.jpg)
**Ex 14**
After getting the form of the head we can extrude the hair

![](/assets/F_15.jpg)
**Ex 15**
With some tweaking it will take form

![](/assets/F_16.jpg)
**Ex 16**
Apply a **mirror modifier** to complete the other half and double check with a **subdivision modifier** or by briefly selecting **"smooth"** in the function menu on the left, to enjoy the results of good polygon spacing. Save without having applied the subdivision modifier.
