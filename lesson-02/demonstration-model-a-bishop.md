**Ex 1**
For our bishop we are going to start with a **cylinder**

![](/assets/D_2.jpg)
**Ex 2**
Press **"n"** to bring up a menu and locate **background image management** within in it

![](/assets/D_3.jpg)
**Ex 3**
**Import and manage** the bishop files accordingly

![](/assets/D_4.jpg)
**Ex 4**
Make sure to **adjust your input preferences** if you do not have a traditional Numpad on your keyboard

![](/assets/D_5.jpg)
**Ex 5**
Use the **"s"** button to **scale the cylinder to the correct size**- make sure that you are in **orthographic mode** by pressing **"5"**

![](/assets/D_6.jpg)
**Ex 6**
**Select and edge.** Then, select **loop and slide.** Once the cursor has been **oriented on the model,** and the **correctly-oriented line** is displayed (in **magenta**) **use the scroll wheel to give yourself several horizontal cuts**

![](/assets/D_7.jpg)
**Ex 7**
Use **"b",** the **border-selection tool** to s**elect and vertically align the horizontal slices to the regions where the most critical changes occur on the object's surface**- make more loop cuts casually **as needed** so as not to flood the viewing plane at first

![](/assets/D_8.jpg)
**Ex 8**
Use the **"s"** key to scale your object. After you select and scale the section cuts (horizontally to fit the bishops width) **make sure that each individual scaling occurs on _both_ the x and y dimensions**

![](/assets/D_9.jpg)
**Ex 9**
Carefully make an **edge-loop**, close to the top, so that you can **merge the top circle using alt or option and "m", followed by "merge to center"**

![](/assets/D_10.jpg)
**Ex 10**
After you have successfully merged your top **make sure that there are only 4 edge loops bisecting the corners of the Bishops cut. This will make the geometry easier to work with later on**

![](/assets/D_11.jpg)
**Ex 11**
Carefully select the vertices making up the interior of the bishop's cut and turn them into a face

![](/assets/D_12.jpg)
**Ex 12**
Next, extrude the face to create another connecting face of identical proportions. Then, **enable snapping** with **to-vertices** specified and use **"g"** to **move the extrusion to the opposite end of the cut **

![](/assets/D_13.jpg)
**Ex 13**
Make sure to constrain your movement accordingly so that the wedge lines up on both axis

![](/assets/D_14.jpg)
**Ex 14**
Carefully select the faces of the four sides of the insert. hold **shift and press "d" to duplicate this form.** Drag it out of the way and left-click to place the duplicate.

![](/assets/D_15.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Press **Shift + "d"** again, followed by **"p"**. **_This is how you duplicate an object to its own layer_**

![](/assets/D_16.jpg)
**Ex 16**
Clean up the extra geometry and floating box from the bishop layer - rename the wedge layer something memorable and insert it back into place on the bishop

![](/assets/D_17.jpg)
**Ex 17**
Select the object layer that you want to carve into. Add a Boolean Modifier, from the window on the right. Choose the necessary settings and select the wedge layer from the entry window. Finally, hit apply.

![](/assets/D_18.jpg)
**Ex 18**
Now, clean up the extra vertices edges and faces.

![](/assets/D_19.jpg)
**Ex 19**
What remains is a reasonably-crafted bishop
