**ART202: 3D Modeling in Blender**

There are a wide variety of software tools available for producing 3D graphics, however, this course will focus on Blender 3D, a fully-featured, open source, and free 3D software application. It is capable of producing 3D objects, video games, animations and more. For the purpose of this class, we will will be using Blender to Model basic 3D objects, apply textures and materials to their surfaces, add lighting to their surfaces / environment and, finally, render compelling images.


**Overview: **
Through the process of this course we are going to learn the fundamentals of modeling in 3D, while assembling our own, unique, 3D modeled chess sets. 


**Lesson 1:** **_The Environment and the Playing Field _**
We will start by creating a board, to familiarize ourselves with the basic editing workflow and to establish a sense of ground in the versatile, malleable and unique, Blender working environment

**Lessons 2-3:** **_The Parts and the Pieces_**
During this continuing, first half of the course, we will gradually learn and implement new editing methods, workflows and operations, as we model gradually more complex objects and refine our techniques.

**Lesson 4:** **_The Surface and Beyond…_**
This is where we really start to see the power behind blender, and how it can turn our 3D parts into more realistic looking objects. 

Through the methods of unwrapping surfaces, creating custom textures (in Photoshop) and UV-Mapping them to our objects, we will begin to demonstrate some of the power behind a 3D Modeling software, such as Blender. 

Through the exploration of materials properties, we will apply physics-based technologies to our object’s meshes that will cover them with convincing surface qualities that can then be built upon, with great effect, through the application light. This is the stage where lead can be made into gold.

**Lesson 5:** **_The Age of Enlightenment_**
Prepare to take your 3D models out of the 18th century and into a brilliant new world of computer-generated light and shadow. Put down your T-Square and stop squinting, because now is the part of the course where the power of the Sun become ours (well, they will want it back later). For the purpose of making Vitruvius jealous (if not anything else) we reach the culminating stage in the course. This is where computer-assisted optics are applied, demonstrating how easy it can be to interpret, essentialize and express material qualities that are ubiquitously discoverable throughout nature.

**Lessons 6-7:** **_Physically Based Rendering _**
We explore various treatments of textures, materials and learn the underlying science of applying optics to create convincing illusions and new realities.

**Lessons 8-9:** **_Creation_**
With the magic of manipulating light and surfaces in-hand, we now venture further into particle systems and tightening our compositions, through added content and rendering refinement processes.

**Lesson 10-12: ** **_The Big Pictures_**
This is the final section of the course. We can look back at all that we have accomplished and document it. We will explore how different rendering methods can produce compelling images, for a myriad of different uses.
