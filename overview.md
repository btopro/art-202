**ART202: 3D Modeling in Blender**

There are a wide variety of software tools available for producing 3D graphics, however, this course will focus on Blender 3D, a fully-featured, open source, and free 3D software application. It is capable of producing 3D objects, video games, animations and more. For the purpose of this class, we will will be using Blender to Model basic 3D objects, apply textures and materials to their surfaces, add lighting to their surfaces / environment and, finally, render compelling images.


**Overview: **
Through the process of this course we are going to learn the fundamentals of modeling in 3D, while assembling our own, unique, 3D modeled chess sets. 


**Week 1-2:** The Environment and the Playing Field 
We will start by creating a board, to familiarize ourselves with the basic editing workflow and to establish a sense of ground in the versatile, malleable and unique, Blender working environment

**Weeks 3-6:** The Parts and the Pieces
During this continuing, first half of the course, we will gradually learn and implement new editing methods, workflows and operations, as we model gradually more complex objects and refine our techniques.

**Weeks 7-9:** The Surface and Beyond…
This is where we really start to see the power behind blender, and how it can turn our 3D parts into more realistic looking objects. 

Through the methods of unwrapping surfaces, creating custom textures (in Photoshop) and UV-Mapping them to our objects, we will begin to demonstrate some of the power behind a 3D Modeling software, such as Blender. 

Through the exploration of materials properties, we will apply physics-based technologies to our object’s meshes that will cover them with convincing surface qualities that can then be built upon, with great effect, through the application light. This is the stage where lead can be made into gold.

**Weeks 10-11:** The Age of Enlightenment
Prepare to take your 3D models out of the 18th century and into a brilliant new world of computer-generated light and shadow. Put down your T-Square and stop squinting, because now is the 	part of the course where the power of the Sun become ours (well, they will want it back later). For the purpose of making Vitruvius jealous (if not anything else) we reach the culminating stage in the course. This is where computer-assisted optics are applied, demonstrating how easy it can be to interpret, essentialize and express material qualities that are ubiquitously discoverable throughout nature.
 
**Week 12: **The Big Pictures
This is the final section of the course. We can look back at all that we have accomplished and document it. We will explore how different rendering methods can produce compelling images, for a myriad of different uses.

**Outline**

**Week 1: **

Navigation of the basic blender interface
Manipulate and customizing the blender environment (windows, selection options)
Different modes, such as editing mode vs object mode and solids vs wireframe 
Distinguishing between vertices, edges and faces 
Editing and workflow features 
Familiarization and practice with Hotkeys and GUI features. 


**Assignments:**

Screen grabs: demonstrate familiarity by using multiple screens and editing modes
Hotkeys: demonstrate the use of hotkeys by completing the following exercises
.
**Week 2:**
**Editing Modes**
Your first modeling assignment: a checkered grid, for the intention of being paired with your future chess-piece-related objects 
Instantiating and manipulating a series of planes (into a checkerboard)
Extruding faces from a plane
Subdividing a face
Creating lines using the Loop cut and slide operations
Cleaning up objects 
Making sure all faces have four edges; deletion, the knife tool consolidating vertices (with and without the sliding technique) to remove duplicates
Trimming lines
Considering modeling strategies by both embracing the notion and demonstrating the understanding that there are many ways to solve any given problem
Layers / Naming conventions
Moving duplicates of completed-stage-objects to hidden layers, as a way of backing-up
