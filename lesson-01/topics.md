# Terms

* File backup: actively keep redundant backups of your work. Save often and iteratively, if necessary.
* Saving iteratively: Save at different points using an incremental naming-scheme. If necessary, keep a log in a text file to keep track of major changes, in case you need to return to an earlier stage.
* Set project: establish a directory structure of  folders that are associated with your work for the course. Keep things organized, both in terms of location and the times that the files are created.
* Naming conventions: Use an incremental style of naming convention, for example "house-12-00-am-01-010-2018"
* Color
* Polygons
* Faces
* Edges
* Points
* Edges
