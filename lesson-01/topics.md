* Polygonal Modeling: "In 3D computer graphics, Polygonal modeling is an approach for modeling objects by representing or approximating their surfaces using polygons" [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_modeling)

* 3D Modeling: "In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or three-dimensional modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object (either inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software."
