**Ex 1**
Start a new file. Delete the cube by first selecting all (**"a"**) and then pressing **"x"**. **Hold "shift" and press "a".** A menu will pop-up. Select a new **plane **from the **mesh section of the menu**.

**Ex 2**
Voila! You have new square-object.

**Ex 3**
Click on the **magnet icon** below the main view port. This will enable snapping.

![](/assets/10.png)
**Ex 4**
**Change the snap element to vertex.** This will give you the most control since we will be snapping squares to each other.


![](/assets/9.png)
**Ex 5**
**Hold "shift"** and **press "d" **to **duplicate** the square.
Next, **click on any of the three colored arrows** and start to **drag the duplicated over toward the original, so that vertices snap together.**

**Ex 9**
You will see a **yellow circle** appear around the **vertex** that you are **snapping towards.**

**Ex 11**
Eventually the squares will be **flush** and **adjacent**.

Next, go to **face-select.**

**Ex 14 **
In this **compound-image**, I am demonstrate a **sequence** of **duplication, arranging parts next to one another and then duplicating multiple parts, to facilitate an increasingly expansive array of identically-sized boxes. **

Use **shift+d **to **duplicate** larger regions, snapping them together, until you have an **8 x 8 grid.**


![](/assets/5_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Eventually, I arrive at enough squares to complete a full, 8 x 8 grid- the proper size of a chessboard.

![](/assets/6_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 16**

In this example, I switch to face-select-mode, select the edges of the board, press "e" for extrude, press "x" or "y" constrain the extrusion to those dimensions and drag-out the edges, to a about value of .25, and click the left mouse-button to commit the extrusion. I then manually override the value in the bottom left window to specify the measurement to exactly .25.

**Ex 17**
Next, after **de-enabling **the **snap-to function**, I select the entire grid, by pressing **"a"**, press **shift + d** to **duplicate** it and hover the duplicate, **precisely, a value of .25 above the original.**

![](/assets/8_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 18**
Next, I manipulate the squares in the corners by making new lines **(selecting vertices and pressing "f", to makes lines or faces in-between them)** and replacing them with diagonal lines.

**Ex 20**
Next, I **enable snapping** and, **engage vertex-select-mode**, and **move / snap the upper, outer-most vertices to the lower ones**, giving the board a **beveled corner.**

![](/assets/10_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 21**
Since the **bottom is not visible**, I will select and delete the interior, line-pattern from underneath.

![](/assets/11_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 11**

Next, I will **select the bottom 4 edges or face** and make a slight (.125), **z-constrained (by pressing the "z-button" after pressing "e") extrusion, downwards.** This gives the impression of a felted-pad, as one may see on a nicer chessboard.
