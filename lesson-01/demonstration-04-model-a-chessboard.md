![Select a new plane from the mesh section of the menu](/assets/14.png)
**Ex 1**
Start a new file. Delete the cube by first selecting all (**"a"**) and then pressing **"x"**. **Hold "shift" and press "a".** A menu will pop-up. Select a new **plane **from the **mesh section of the menu**.


![You have new square object](/assets/13.png)
**Ex 2**
Voila! You have new square-object.


![Click on the magnet icon below the main view port](/assets/12.png)
**Ex 3**
Click on the **magnet icon** below the main view port. This will enable snapping.

![Change the snap element to vertex](/assets/10.png)
**Ex 4**
**Change the snap element to vertex.** This will give you the most control since we will be snapping squares to each other.


![Hold shift and press d to duplicate the square](/assets/9.png)
**Ex 5**
**Hold "shift"** and **press "d" **to **duplicate** the square.
Next, **click on any of the three colored arrows** and start to **drag the duplicated over toward the original, so that vertices snap together.**


![Drag from the arrow to match with the relative dimension on the original square](/assets/8.png)
**Ex 6**
Drag from the arrow to match with the relative dimension on the original square, until you see a yellow circle

![Theres the yellow circle
](/assets/7.png)
**Ex 7**
There's the yellow circle


![Drag from a different arrow and match to a different dimension](/assets/6.png)
**Ex 8**
Drag from a different arrow and match to a different dimension. Soon they will both be parallel and flush


![You will see a yellow circle appear around the vertex that you are snapping towards](/assets/5.png)
**Ex 9**
You will see a **yellow circle** appear around the **vertex** that you are **snapping towards.**


![With time it will all be done](/assets/4.png)
**Ex 10**
With time it will all be done

![Eventually the squares will be flush and adjacent](/assets/3.png)
**Ex 11**
Eventually the squares will be **flush** and **adjacent**.


![Look at that](/assets/2.png)
**Ex 12**
Look at that!


![Next go to face select](/assets/1.png)
**Ex 13**
Next, go to **face-select.**


![I am demonstrate a sequence of duplication and arranging parts next to one another and then duplicating multiple parts](/assets/4_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 14 **
In this **compound-image**, I am demonstrate a **sequence** of **duplication, arranging parts next to one another and then duplicating multiple parts, to facilitate an increasingly expansive array of identically-sized boxes. **

Use **shift+d **to **duplicate** larger regions, snapping them together, until you have an **8 x 8 grid.**


![the proper size of a chessboard](/assets/5_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Eventually, I arrive at enough squares to complete a full, 8 x 8 grid- the proper size of a chessboard.

![select the edges of the board, press e for extrude](/assets/6_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 16**

In this example, I switch to face-select-mode, select the edges of the board, press "e" for extrude, press "x" or "y" constrain the extrusion to those dimensions and drag-out the edges, to a about value of .25, and click the left mouse-button to commit the extrusion. I then manually override the value in the bottom left window to specify the measurement to exactly .25.


![hover the duplicate above the original](/assets/7_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 17**
Next, after **de-enabling **the **snap-to function**, I select the entire grid, by pressing **"a"**, press **shift + d** to **duplicate** it and hover the duplicate, **precisely, a value of .25 above the original.**

![manipulate the squares in the corners by making new lines](/assets/8_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 18**
Next, I manipulate the squares in the corners by making new lines **(selecting vertices and pressing "f", to makes lines or faces in-between them)** and replacing them with diagonal lines.
![](/assets/9_checkerboard.jpg)

**Ex 20**
Next, I **enable snapping** and, **engage vertex-select-mode**, and **move / snap the upper, outer-most vertices to the lower ones**, giving the board a **beveled corner.**

![enable snapping and engage vertex select mode](/assets/10_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 21**
Since the **bottom is not visible**, I will select and delete the interior, line-pattern from underneath.

![select the bottom 4 edges or face](/assets/11_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 11**

Next, I will **select the bottom 4 edges or face** and make a slight (.125), **z-constrained (by pressing the "z-button" after pressing "e") extrusion, downwards.** This gives the impression of a felted-pad, as one may see on a nicer chessboard.

![Looking c,close](/assets/12_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 12**
Looking close


![Closer](/assets/13_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 13**
Closer

![Done](/assets/14_checkerboard.jpg)
**Ex 14**
Done!
