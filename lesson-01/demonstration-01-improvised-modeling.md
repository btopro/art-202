Welcome to the **Blender 3D -Modeling Environment**.

This is what Blender's main screen looks like when you first open it up

As you can see, there is a **main-navigational / viewing portal** in the center of the screen.

In the upper right of the screen you will see that there are **two main windows.**

The **upper window** allows you to select objects, such as the **cameras** (visibly displayed on the screen, with black lines and an arrow above it), **lights** (to the upper right of the cube) or objects. In this case, we are interested in the **cube object**.

The window below this serves many purposes. It is mostly used in this course for making **modifications** and **rendering**. More on this later.
 
![](/assets/A_2.jpg)
**Ex: 2**
If you go to the top of the screen you'll see that there is a **menu** called **File**. **Select this.**

![](/assets/A_3.jpg)
**Ex: 3**
Select and open up **user preferences**.

![](/assets/A_4 .jpg)
**Ex: 4**

If you are working on a laptop that does not have a dedicated number pad then select **Emulate Numpad** from within the **Input Tab**. **This will allow you to toggle through very useful camera views by pressing different, individual numbers.** You will see how important this is, early on, as we begin **tracing reference images** to direct our modeling decisions.

![](/assets/A_5.jpg)
**Ex: 5**
By default the program presents a cube within what is called **object-mode.**

![](/assets/A_6.jpg)
**Ex: 6**
Use the indicated drop menu or the tab button to go between **object** and **edit-modes**. **Object-mode** will show you what the object generally looks like. **Edit-mode** will present the object in an editable manner, where you can choose between selecting **vertices, edges and faces** to make your edits.

**Vertices** are the point in between the edges.

**Edges** are the lines between the vertices.

**Faces** are the planes between 3 or more connected points. 

**For the purpose of modeling in Blender, we are going to focus on using primarily 4-sided faces when possible. If needed, 3 is acceptable.** The reason for this is because there are processes that occur in later stages of rendering, and it is most important to be consistent, for the purpose of having a consistent render. **In the case of flat or hidden surfaces, higher-polygon-count faces are sometimes acceptable.** We will discuss this further in the future.

![](/assets/A_7.jpg)
**Ex: 7**
You can use the **scroll-wheel** within the **viewport** to **zoom in and out**.

![](/assets/A_8.jpg)
**Ex: 8**
You can use **"Z"** button to toggle in and out of **wireframe** and **bounding box modes** or use the indicated sub menu. **Wireframe mode** is particularly helpful as it allows you see beyond otherwise **impeding surfaces** that may be in the way.

![](/assets/A_9.jpg)
**Ex: 9**
If you push down on the **scroll-wheel** or otherwise known as **middle mouse button** and drag you can change your **orientation**. This procedure is also known as **orbiting**.

![](/assets/A_10.jpg)
**Ex: 10**
If you press the **number keys **you will see that they change your perspective to **specific views such as top, left bottom, right, front and back**

![](/assets/A_11.jpg)
**Ex: 11**
Pressing the **number five** will toggle between **two-point perspective** and **orthogonal** views. **Orthogonal** views force geometry to line up relative to the perspective of the viewer. It has the functionality of distorting things in a specific manner so that **image-tracing** can be possible.

![](/assets/A_12.jpg)
**Ex: 12**
You can **stretch** or **expand menus** and **windows** by dragging on their **dividers**

![](/assets/A_13.jpg)
**Ex: 13**
Here you can see that I have expanded the **function menu** on the left and the modifier and **layer menus** on the right

![](/assets/A_14.jpg)
**Ex: 14**
You can click and drag-out / expand windows, by clicking on and **dragging from the lines in the corners**

![](/assets/A_15.jpg)
**Ex: 15**
You can change each **partitioned window** into a different and specific **view-type.**

![](/assets/A_16.jpg)
**Ex: 16**
You can also set up a screen to view from a **camera** for the purpose of **rendering specific angles**

![](/assets/A_17.jpg)
**Ex: 17**
By holding down the **shift and middle** mouse button you can **pan** your view, left, right, up and down.

![](/assets/A_18.jpg)
**Ex: 18**
By clicking on the **lines in the corner** of any **view window** you can drag it over other windows to **collapse them**

![](/assets/A_19.jpg)
**Ex: 19**
Expand the **modifier menu** on the right.

![](/assets/A_20.jpg)
**Ex: 20**
If you click on the wrench tab and then on add modifier you can find a list of potential **modifiers** to chose from.

![](/assets/A_21.jpg)
**Ex: 21**
It's important that you familiarize yourself with the various **orbiting** and **panning methods**

![](/assets/A_22.jpg)
**Ex: 22**
Here we have an example of the **default cube** in **wireframe mode** which makes it easier to see through it.

![](/assets/A_23.jpg)
**Ex: 23**
**These three icons** allow you to choose between **vertex, line and face-selection modes.**

![](/assets/A_24.jpg)
**Ex: 24**
Under **face mode** you can **right-click** on the black squares to select the corresponding faces

![](/assets/A_25.jpg)
**Ex: 25**
If you continue holding the **shift button** and selecting faces you can select several at a time

![](/assets/A_26.jpg)
**Ex: 26**
You can then perform operations to multiple faces at once, such as extruding them.

![](/assets/A_27.jpg)
**Ex: 27**
Observe the different behavior between **extrude region** and **extrude individual**. Each of these methods are helpful under different circumstances.

![](/assets/A_28.jpg)
**Ex: 28**
Pressing **"A"** will deselect the already selected faces. 

![](/assets/A_29.jpg)
**Ex: 29**
Pressing **"A"** another additional time will select all faces.

![](/assets/A_30a.jpg)
**Ex: 30a**
You can also **subdivide** the faces- breaking them into even, unique-distributed, smaller faces. 

![](/assets/A_30b.jpg)
**Ex: 30b**

**Subdividing** will help you take control over forming your object in finer detail. 

![](/assets/A_31.jpg)
**Ex: 31**
The **line Selection mode **lets you take control of your object through manipulating individual lines.

![](/assets/A_32.jpg)
**Ex: 32**
**Vertex mode** allows you to select individual vertices

![](/assets/A_33 .jpg)
**Ex: 33**
**Wireframe** makes it much easier to see sometimes, especially when selecting parts of the object behind the immediate faces.

![](/assets/A_34.jpg)
**Ex: 34**
Here I use the **shrink or fatten** function to narrow the gap

![](/assets/A_35.jpg)
**Ex: 35**
After pressing **"Z"** to see the frames my object is starting to look like some kind of crystal or ore.

![](/assets/A_36.jpg)
**Ex: 36**
If we then audition the image with the **subdivision modifier**, we can see that it curves a bit more- almost looking like a cashew or peanut

![](/assets/A_37.jpg)
**Ex: 37**
**Selecting vertices**: using the **"c"-Key-circle** or "b-Key"-marqui**-**selection tools** with the **wireframe-mode** makes it easier to quickly **grab entire regions.**

![](/assets/A_38 .jpg)
**Ex: 38**
With the **"r-key"-rotate function** you can **constrain to specific axis by typing an additional x y or z and then moving your mouse or typing a specific angle.**

![](/assets/A_39.jpg)
**Ex: 39**
Next I will **return to bounding box** mode and **remove the subdivision modifier**

![](/assets/A_40.jpg)
**Ex: 41**
Next, I select some **vertices**, press **"x"** to **delete** them, after first **specifying that I want to delete vertices**

![](/assets/A_41.jpg)
**Ex: 41**
It is preferable in Blender  to use faces of **4-sides** so I select sets of **4 immediately neighboring pairs** and **press the "F-Key" to join them as faces**

![](/assets/A_42.jpg)
**Ex: 42**
Next I press, together, **"ctrl, alt or option" and "q-keys"** to enter **quad view mode**

![](/assets/A_43.jpg)
**Ex: 43**
Next I use the **border-select tool** by pressing the **"b-key"** and I attempt to make **clean edges** of **vertices**

![](/assets/A_44.jpg)
**Ex: 44**
Eventually, the form becomes boxier, with a little work.

![](/assets/A_45.jpg)
**Ex: 45**
Here I **select an edge** and **press loop cut and slide**

![](/assets/A_46.jpg)
**Ex: 46**
**Loop cut and slide** is a versatile tool and can be used similarly to the **subdivision function / modifier** but allows for certain additional utilities.

![](/assets/A_47.jpg)
**Ex: 47**
Here I select and evenly stagger points

![](/assets/A_48.jpg)
**Ex: 48**
This is what it could look like with some **scaling** and **subdivision**

![](/assets/A_49.jpg)
**Ex: 49**
Once you **increase the number of subdivisions** you can see that the shape goes from colder and more mechanical / edgy into a more curvy, soft and organic form

![](/assets/A_50.jpg)
**Ex: 50**
However, that's getting ahead of ourselves- what we more concerned about is **proportionatal distribution of polygons**, at this stage, so let's **remove to the subdivision modifier**

![](/assets/A_51.jpg)

it's always good to save in incremental states- here I revert to an earlier version when we were working with this peanut looking thing

![](/assets/A_52.jpg)

I select the whole thing using the "A" key

![](/assets/A_53.jpg) 

by pressing g for scale and then z to constrain deformation to one dimension I am able to flatten the peanut into a something more like a biscuit

![](/assets/A_54.jpg)

if you zoom out it almost looks like the beginning of the form for a seahorse

![](/assets/A_55a.jpg)

Here we press g to scale and y to constrain deformation to the Y axis

![](/assets/A_55b.jpg)

here we use the same method but choose to compress it by giving negative values for Y

![](/assets/A_56.jpg)

Here we press r to rotate the shape and again we can use constrain to dimension- also you can override the manually rotated measurement by typing in a specific value- this also work for scaling

![](/assets/A_57.jpg)

at this point we are just playing around with features- improvising- trying to treat this all like clay- so let's rotate this clump and mirror it

![](/assets/A_58.jpg)

and like clay let's select mirror on the Y axis and smash them into each other

![](/assets/A_59.jpg)

at this point in time you can simply push and pull them apart and there is no deformation- because the mirroring has not been applied

![](/assets/A_60.jpg)

however once clipping is applied vertices will terminate their location whenever they come upon the origin points of reflection

![](/assets/A_61.jpg)

I don't know about you but I think this sort of looks like a cartoon cat so let's go with it

![](/assets/A_62.jpg)

if you look at this in wireframe mode you can see that there's some unwanted geometry inside of the mesh

![](/assets/A_63.jpg)

let's upon up the hood by deleting a face and take a look inside

![](/assets/A_64.jpg)
after selecting and deleting the vertices I select the exterior three vertices and press F to make Triangular face where the gap was

![](/assets/A_65.jpg)

let's see if we can expand on my cat theory

![](/assets/A_66.jpg)

let's select this middle side of the face and enable the indicated proportional editing mode using the default settings

![](/assets/A_67.jpg)

let's leave proportional editing on and deform the mesh a bit

![](/assets/A_68.jpg)

this is starting to look more cat like

![](/assets/A_69.jpg)

a little more cat like

![](/assets/A_70.jpg)

I will now go to the select tab and select edge loops

![](/assets/A_71.jpg)

now I will click on the red arrow and drag this portion of the mesh inwards

![](/assets/A_72.jpg)

I want to rework the back so I select face from face mode and begin deleting

![](/assets/A_73.jpg)

in order to keep all the faces at 4 sides I reinsert an interior segment at the point of reflection and press w for a submenu- and select subdivide- now this face can be rebuilt with four points

![](/assets/A_74.jpg)

next I will select the front-most edge loop and drag the red portion of the 3D cursor to extend the face outwards

![](/assets/A_75.jpg)

the ears will need some tweaking

![](/assets/A_76.jpg)

let's audition this under the subdivision modifier to get a clearer sense of where our geometry does and does not work

![](/assets/A_77.jpg)

those eyes are really not defined- lets delete the modifier and continue

![](/assets/A_78.jpg)

Here I create additional edge-loops for increased definition

![](/assets/A_79.jpg)

Here I reenable proportional editing and pull from the mesh with the sphere setting to create googly eyes

![](/assets/A_80.jpg)

I decide to push the faces in the opposite direction to create eye cavities

![](/assets/A_81.jpg)

After some cleaning up this is starting to look even more like a cat face

![](/assets/A_82.jpg)

Here I auditioned the face in Quad view mode under a subdivision modifier to get a sense of where this could go if I were to have continued
