**Introduction to 3D Modeling (ART 202): Syllabus **

Instructor: K. Ian Brill
Summer 2018

**
Description:**

**
3D Modeling in Blender**
There are a wide variety of software tools available for producing 3D graphics, however, this course will focus on Blender 3D, a fully-featured, open source, and free 3D software application. It is capable of producing 3D objects, video games, animations and more. For the purpose of this class, we will will be using Blender to Model basic 3D objects, apply textures and materials to their surfaces, add lighting to their surfaces / environment and, finally, render compelling images.


**
Learning Objectives**

* Develop an understanding of the fundamentals of 3D modeling, in Blender

* Render scenes of 3D images using elements built entirely from scratch

* Understand the various components that go into developing 3D objects 

* Design Textures, materials and lighting

* Learn the fundamental physical properties that are manipulated to create compelling 3D graphics

* Develop the problem-solving skills and techniques necessary to approach systematically modeling anything

**
Requirements
**
* Blender: Blender is free, open-source software. Version 2.79b can be acquired here: https://www.blender.org/download/

* Adobe Creative Cloud: Students are required to purchase the Adobe Creative Suite for this class, luckily it's free for students at Penn State (normally $20/month student license). To set up your complimentary Adobe license, students should "purchase" it from the Penn State store for a cost of $0.00 before downloading the Adobe Creative Cloud app from Adobe. Once installed, you can enter your PSU credentials when you log into the app, and download specific applications. For this class we will use Adobe Photoshop 


* A modern computer: 3D software is demanding of computational resources. Your machine must meet the following specifications, at the very the least:

* Dual-core processor; 2 GHz or faster (more cores = faster performance).
Microsoft Windows 7 or above; or Apple OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) or above.
2GB Ram (8GB recommended) 
10GB available hard-disk space (more for large projects)

* See the complete system requirements for Blender and Adobe Photoshop  

* 3-Button Mouse: Students will need to purchase a 3-Button mouse. These are typically under $10-20.

Online Ecosystem
**
We will utilize a few different platforms for this course. Please email me with general questions.

**Canvas:** The university’s central Learning Management System (LMS). This is where you can find your grades, some assignments, links to other content, contact info for everyone in the course. Canvas assignments are only visible to the instructor.

**Course Website:** The website is the main face for our course. Each week will consist of a series of demonstrations, links to tutorials, and other advanced features that we can’t implement in Canvas. You can always get to the site by clicking on the current week in Canvas. 

**Open Studio:** Within the Course website, there is a page called Open Studio that functions as a class-wide gallery where students can post images and comment on each other's work. 

**
Course Structure**

Each lesson include the same general sequence of assignments, but there is some variance. Here's a sample schedule for a lesson:

* View demonstrations, tutorials and links in the respective "Topics" sections
* Model the assignment
* Provide feedback on your classmate’s work, in open studio
* Re-submit your work, upon making corrections

**
Grading**

Students will receive a grade for each lesson based on the following assignments:
**Assignment (50 points) **
**Studio Comments (10 points, 5 each)**
**Corrected Assignment (50 points)** - Respond to comments from other students and feedback from professor

_Note that some lessons may have additional or fewer assignments.

Grading Scale:**

93–100: A 
90-92: A-
87-89: B+
83-86: B
80-82: B-
77-79: C+

**
Schedule** 
Through the process of this course we are going to learn the fundamentals of modeling in 3D, while assembling our own, unique, 3D modeled chess sets. 


**

We will start by creating a board, to familiarize ourselves with the basic editing workflow and to establish a sense of ground in the versatile, malleable and unique, Blender working environment

* Navigation of the basic blender interface

* Explore different modes, such as editing mode vs object mode and solids vs wireframe
* Distinguishing between vertices, edges and faces
* Editing and workflow features

**
Lessons 2: The Parts and the Pieces Part 1**
During this continuing, first half of the course, we will gradually learn and implement new editing methods, workflows and operations, as we model gradually more complex objects and refine our techniques.
* Importing source images
* Practice tracing and inferring geometry from source images

Lesson 4: The Surface and Beyond…**
This is where we really start to see the power behind blender, and how it can turn our 3D parts into more realistic looking objects.

Through the methods of unwrapping surfaces, creating custom textures (in Photoshop) and UV-Mapping them to our objects, we will begin to demonstrate some of the power behind a 3D Modeling software, such as Blender.

Through the exploration of materials properties, we will apply physics-based technologies to our object’s meshes that will cover them with convincing surface qualities that can then be built upon, with great effect, through the application light. This is the stage where lead can be made into gold.

* Unwrapping geometry
* Exporting unwrapped surfaces
* Making a custom set using texture mapping / photoshop
* UV mapping textures to your pieces / board
Introduction to the node system

Lesson 5: The Age of Enlightenment**
Prepare to take your 3D models out of the 18th century and into a brilliant new world of computer-generated light and shadow. Put down your T-Square and stop squinting, because now is the part of the course where the power of the Sun become ours (well, they will want it back later). For the purpose of making Vitruvius jealous (if not anything else) we reach the culminating stage in the course. This is where computer-assisted optics are applied, demonstrating how easy it can be to interpret, essentialize and express material qualities that are ubiquitously discoverable throughout nature.

Policies**

**
Plagiarism in Digital Art**
For this course, students will frequently use images and media assets that they did not create themselves. If you have space in your project, it’s a good idea to credit the authors of any found images. This isn’t strictly required for student work, but it’s good to start this habit for professional work. 

Found images should always be used as supporting elements within your own original work. Using templates or copying entire compositions and imagery from existing sources will severely impact your grade for a given project. Even if you’re adding an icon or supporting illustration, you will always be graded more favorably for creating images yourself. 

**Affirmative Action & Sexual Harassment**
The Pennsylvania State University is committed to a policy that all persons shall have equal
access to programs, facilities, admission, and employment without regard to personal
characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by University

**An Invitation to Students with Learning Disabilities**
It is Penn State's policy to not discriminate against qualified students with documented disabilities in its educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for modifications in your testing or learning situation, your instructor should be notified during the first week of classes so that your needs can be accommodated. You will be asked to present documentation from the Office of Disability Services (located in 116 Boucke Building, 863-1807) that describes the nature of your disability and the recommended remedy. You may refer to the Nondiscrimination Policy in the Student Guide to University Policies and Rules.
