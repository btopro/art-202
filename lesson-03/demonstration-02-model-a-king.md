**Ex 1**
Setup for the king begins the same as earlier pieces- you swap out the cube with a cylinder

![](/assets/G_2.jpg)
**Ex 2**
Insert **edge-loops** and b**egin scaling** them to fit changes on the implied contours

![](/assets/G_3.jpg)
**Ex 3**
After not too much work your should see something like this

![](/assets/G_4.jpg)
**Ex 4**
The cross will take little extra thought and effort

![](/assets/G_5.jpg)
**Ex 5**
Start by isolating the base of the cross by defining the intersecting faces that approximate its footprint

![](/assets/G_6.jpg)
**Ex 6**
Here you see the first strip of two parallel faces that define the **x-bounds** of the cross's base

![](/assets/G_7.jpg)
**Ex 7**
By **changing perspective between front and side** the perpendicular strip is easy enough to create

![](/assets/G_8.jpg)
**Ex 8**
The step is more subtle- **we create an extrusion of the lip and scale it inwards- without getting as far as touching the square**

![](/assets/G_9.jpg)
**Ex 9**
Next **enable snapping with to vertices specified and snap the vertices in the extruded lip to their natural intersection points along the square - measure the extensions to the vertices on the sides to determine the accurate length**

![](/assets/G_10.jpg)
**Ex 10**
It will be a little fuzzy at first but the method becomes intuitive through repetition

![](/assets/G_11.jpg)
**Ex 11**
At this point you can begin **deleting the reference lines we created**

![](/assets/G_12.jpg)
**Ex 12**
This is looking like we intended

![](/assets/G_13.jpg)
**Ex 13**
View from the front or back and **extrude the square through the first vertical section upwards**

![](/assets/G_14.jpg)
**Ex 14**
Repeat process through the middle segment

![](/assets/G_15.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Reach the top

![](/assets/G_16.jpg)
**Ex 16**
Extend the side faces out where needed to **match the reference image**

![](/assets/G_17.jpg)
**Ex 17**
From within object mode this is looking pretty good
