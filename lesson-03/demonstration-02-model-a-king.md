setup for the king begins the same as earlier pieces- you swap out the cube with a cylinder

![](/assets/G_2.jpg)

insert edge loops and begin scaling them to fit changes on the implied contours

![](/assets/G_3.jpg)

after not too much work your should see something like this

![](/assets/G_4.jpg)

the cross will take little extra thought and effort

![](/assets/G_5.jpg)

start by isolating the base of the cross by defining the intersecting faces that approximate its footprint

![](/assets/G_6.jpg)

here you see the first strip of two parallel faces that define the x bounds of the cross's base

![](/assets/G_7.jpg)

by changing perspective between front and side the perpendicular strip is easy enough to create

![](/assets/G_8.jpg)

The step is more subtle- we create an extrusion of the lip and scale it inwards- without getting as far as touching the square

![](/assets/G_9.jpg)

next enable snapping with to vertices specified and snap the vertices in the extruded lip to their natural intersection points along the square - measure the extensions to the vertices on the sides to determine the accurate length

![](/assets/G_10.jpg)

it will be a little fuzzy at first but the method becomes intuitive through repetition

![](/assets/G_11.jpg)

at this point you can begin deleting the reference lines we created

![](/assets/G_12.jpg)

this is looking like we intended

![](/assets/G_13.jpg)

view from the front or back and extrude the square through the first vertical section upwards

![](/assets/G_14.jpg)

repeat process through the middle segment

![](/assets/G_15.jpg)

reach the top

![](/assets/G_16.jpg)

extend the side faces out where needed to match the reference image

![](/assets/G_17.jpg)

from within object mode this is looking pretty good
