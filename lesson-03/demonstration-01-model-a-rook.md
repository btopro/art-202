**Ex 1**
Now, we are going to build a rook using the same initial methods as before but this time with a cube

![](/assets/E_2.jpg)

right away we are going to mirror it

![](/assets/E_3.jpg)

use edge loops or subdivisions to create a grid that matches up to the reference image

![](/assets/E_4.jpg)

build out the rook much like we have been doing

![](/assets/E_5.jpg)

this should be pretty easy by now

![](/assets/E_6.jpg)

next we will chisel away at the gaps and vertices

![](/assets/E_7.jpg)

the exterior should be pretty straightforward

![](/assets/E_8.jpg)

make some lines by selecting vertices and hitting "F"

![](/assets/E_9.jpg)

make the necessary subdivisions and cuts

![](/assets/E_10.jpg)

work with the tools you have to organize a consistent grid

![](/assets/E_11.jpg)

work all views as needed

![](/assets/E_12.jpg)

get comfortable using loop-cuts

![](/assets/E_13.jpg)

with some trial and error the top should start to come together

![](/assets/E_14.jpg)

rotate through your views to check for errors

![](/assets/E_15.jpg)

![](/assets/E_16.jpg)

Once a good grid is established it's easy to clear away what's not needed and frame out what is

![](/assets/E_17.jpg)

mirroring will make things wrap up a lot faster as well
