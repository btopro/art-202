next we build a queen starting with the cylinder and reference files

![](/assets/H_2.jpg)

resize the object as needed to match the reference image

![](/assets/H_3.jpg)

prepare to insert loop cuts

![](/assets/H_3b.jpg)

use the scroll wheel to increase the number of loop cuts and position them

![](/assets/H_4.jpg)

try not to use to many loop cuts but suggest the ins and outs of the original form

![](/assets/H_5.jpg)

make additional loop cuts as needed

![](/assets/H_6.jpg)

start to scale the sides in horizontally making sure that you are only scaling on the x and y axis

![](/assets/H_7.jpg)

double check that the proper dimensions are being constrained

![](/assets/H_8.jpg)

you have to be extra careful to check when scaling multiple loop cuts at a time

![](/assets/H_9.jpg)

sometimes it makes sense to fit portions to make planning easier- to use fewer loop cuts to suggest the original geometry

![](/assets/H_10.jpg)

be careful to use a tightly spaced additional loop cut to merge the top most vertices to their center using alt or option and m

![](/assets/H_11.jpg)

![](/assets/H_12.jpg)

![](/assets/H_13.jpg)

this is a reasonable approximation with not too few loop cuts- notice that loop-cuts define the top and bottom most bounds of the circles

![](/assets/H_14.jpg)

these circles will actually be used to suggest the bounds of a single uninterrupted and curved lip

![](/assets/H_15.jpg)

use a loop cut to make a line that cuts through each of their centers

![](/assets/H_16.jpg)

from another perspective you can see that this is low on the Z dimension

![](/assets/H_17.jpg)

here I extrude the lip upwards and past the circles and beyond the model

![](/assets/H_18c.jpg)

next I extrude the lip again down to the top of the circles

![](/assets/H_19.jpg)

this doesn't look great so lets get ready of the extra geometry

![](/assets/H_20.jpg)

Simply select the top rim and delete

![](/assets/H_20a.jpg)

copy the remaining line using shift and D and then after placing hit P to send it to its own object layer

![](/assets/H_21.jpg)

select and name this new layer- Press alt and c to turn this polygonal model into curve or NURB

![](/assets/H_22.jpg)

enter the nurbs-curve tab on right-hand-side

![](/assets/H_23.jpg)

set fill mode to full and adjust the depth

![](/assets/H_24.jpg)

position the NURB over the original model and refer to the various reverence models for placement

![](/assets/H_25.jpg)

adjust the depth and resolution until things look and feel right

![](/assets/H_26.jpg)

I am comfortable with this

![](/assets/H_27.jpg)

select the curb and hit alt c to turn the NURB back into a polygonal mesh

![](/assets/H_28.jpg)

it should look something like this

![](/assets/H_29.jpg)

we are going to use a boolean modifier again- this time unifying the two objects

![](/assets/H_30.jpg)

once completed it should look something like this

![](/assets/H_31.jpg)

notice that boolean operation eliminated all of the internal geometry for us
