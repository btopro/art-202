Next we build a queen starting with the **cylinder** and **reference files**

![Resize the object as needed to match the reference image](/assets/H_2.jpg)
**Ex 2**
**Resize** the object as needed to match the reference image

![Prepare to insert loop cuts](/assets/H_3.jpg)
**Ex 3a**
Prepare to insert **loop-cuts**

![Use the scroll wheel to increase the number of loop cuts and position them](/assets/H_3b.jpg)

![Try not to use to many loop-cuts but enough to suggest the ins and outs of the original form](/assets/H_4.jpg)
**Ex 4**
Try not to use to many loop-cuts but enough to suggest the ins and outs of the original form

![Make additional loop cuts as needed](/assets/H_5.jpg)
**Ex 5**
Make additional loop-cuts as needed

![Start to scale the sides in horizontally making sure that you are only scaling on the x and y axis](/assets/H_6.jpg)
**Ex 6**
Start to scale the sides in horizontally **making sure that you are only scaling on the x and y axis**

![Double check that the proper dimensions are being constrained](/assets/H_7.jpg)
**Ex 7**
Double-check that the proper dimensions are being **constrained**

![You have to be extra careful to check the dimensions are constrained and everything is selected when scaling multiple loop cuts at a time](/assets/H_8.jpg)
**Ex 8**
You have to be extra careful to check the dimensions are constrained and everything is selected, when scaling multiple loop-cuts at a time

![Sometimes it makes sense to fit portions to make planning easier](/assets/H_9.jpg)
**Ex 9**
Sometimes it makes sense to fit portions to make planning easier. Use a few more loop-cuts to suggest the original geometry

![Be careful to use a tightly spaced additional loop cut on the top](/assets/H_10.jpg)
**Ex 10**
Be careful to use a tightly-spaced, additional loop-cut on the top. Merge the top-most vertices to their center, by using **alt or option + m**

![Press alt or option + M](/assets/H_11.jpg)
**Ex 11**
Press alt or option + M

![And Merge](/assets/H_12.jpg)
**Ex 12**
And Merge

![This is a reasonable approximation](/assets/H_13.jpg)
**Ex 13**
This is a reasonable approximation with not too few loop-cuts. Notice that loop-cuts define the top and bottom most bounds of the circles

![These circles will actually be used to suggest the bounds of a single uninterrupted and curved lip](/assets/H_14.jpg)
**Ex 14**
These circles will actually be used to suggest the bounds of a single, uninterrupted and curved lip

![Use a loop cut to make a line that cuts through each of their centers](/assets/H_15.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Use a loop-cut to make a line that cuts through each of their centers

![From another perspective you can see that this is low on the Z dimension](/assets/H_16.jpg)
**Ex 16**
From another perspective you can see that this is low on the Z dimension

![Here I extrude the lip upwards](/assets/H_17.jpg)
**Ex 17**
Here I extrude the lip upwards, past the circles and beyond the model

![Next I extrude the lip again down to the top of the circles](/assets/H_18c.jpg)
**Ex 18**
Next I extrude the lip again down to the top of the circles

![lets get ready of the extra geometry](/assets/H_19.jpg)
**Ex 19**
This doesn't look great so lets get ready of the extra geometry

![Simply select the top rim and delete](/assets/H_20.jpg)
**Ex 20a**
Simply select the top rim and delete

![Copy the remaining line using shift and pressing D](/assets/H_20a.jpg)
**Ex 20b**
Copy the remaining line using shift + "d". After placing, press **"p"** to send it to **its own object layer**

![Select and name this new layer](/assets/H_21.jpg)
**Ex 21**
**Select and name this new layer** **Press alt or option + c to turn this polygonal model into curve or NURB**

![Enter the nurbs curve tab on right hand side](/assets/H_22.jpg)
