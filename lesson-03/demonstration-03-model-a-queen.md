![](/assets/queen side.jpg)**Reference image 1**
Use side for both sides
![](/assets/queen top.jpg)**Reference image 2**
![](/assets/queen front and back.jpg)**Reference image 3**
Use front and back for both front and back

![](/assets/H_1.jpg)
**Ex 1**
Next we build a queen starting with the cylinder and reference files

![](/assets/H_2.jpg)
**Ex 2**
Resize the object as needed to match the reference image

![](/assets/H_3.jpg)
**Ex 3a**
Prepare to insert loop cuts

![](/assets/H_3b.jpg)
**Ex 3b**
Use the scroll wheel to increase the number of loop cuts and position them

![](/assets/H_4.jpg)
**Ex 4**
Try not to use to many loop cuts but suggest the ins and outs of the original form

![](/assets/H_5.jpg)
**Ex 5**
Make additional loop cuts as needed

![](/assets/H_6.jpg)
**Ex 6**
Start to scale the sides in horizontally making sure that you are only scaling on the x and y axis

![](/assets/H_7.jpg)
**Ex 7**
Double-check that the proper dimensions are being constrained

![](/assets/H_8.jpg)
**Ex 8**
You have to be extra careful to check when scaling multiple loop cuts at a time

![](/assets/H_9.jpg)
**Ex 9**
Sometimes it makes sense to fit portions to make planning easier- to use fewer loop cuts to suggest the original geometry

![](/assets/H_10.jpg)
**Ex 10**
Be careful to use a tightly spaced additional loop cut to merge the top most vertices to their center using alt or option and m

![](/assets/H_11.jpg)
**Ex 11**

![](/assets/H_12.jpg)
**Ex 12**

![](/assets/H_13.jpg)
**Ex 13**
This is a reasonable approximation with not too few loop cuts- notice that loop-cuts define the top and bottom most bounds of the circles

![](/assets/H_14.jpg)
**Ex 14**
These circles will actually be used to suggest the bounds of a single uninterrupted and curved lip

![](/assets/H_15.jpg)
**Ex 15**
Use a loop cut to make a line that cuts through each of their centers

![](/assets/H_16.jpg)
**Ex 16**
From another perspective you can see that this is low on the Z dimension

![](/assets/H_17.jpg)
**Ex 17**
Here I extrude the lip upwards and past the circles and beyond the model

![](/assets/H_18c.jpg)
**Ex 18**
Next I extrude the lip again down to the top of the circles

![](/assets/H_19.jpg)
**Ex 19**
This doesn't look great so lets get ready of the extra geometry

![](/assets/H_20.jpg)
**Ex 20a**
Simply select the top rim and delete

![](/assets/H_20a.jpg)
**Ex 20b**
Copy the remaining line using shift and D and then after placing hit P to send it to its own object layer

![](/assets/H_21.jpg)
**Ex 21**
Select and name this new layer- Press alt and c to turn this polygonal model into curve or NURB

![](/assets/H_22.jpg)
**Ex 22**
Enter the nurbs-curve tab on right-hand-side

![](/assets/H_23.jpg)
**Ex 23**
Set fill mode to full and adjust the depth

![](/assets/H_24.jpg)
**Ex 24**
Position the NURB over the original model and refer to the various reverence models for placement

![](/assets/H_25.jpg)
**Ex 25**
Adjust the depth and resolution until things look and feel right

![](/assets/H_26.jpg)
**Ex 26**
I am comfortable with this

![](/assets/H_27.jpg)
**Ex 27**
Select the curb and hit alt c to turn the NURB back into a polygonal mesh

![](/assets/H_28.jpg)
**Ex 28**
It should look something like this

![](/assets/H_29.jpg)
**Ex 29**
We are going to use a boolean modifier again- this time unifying the two objects

![](/assets/H_30.jpg)
**Ex 30**
Once completed it should look something like this

![](/assets/H_31.jpg)
**Ex 31**
Notice that boolean operation eliminated all of the internal geometry for us
