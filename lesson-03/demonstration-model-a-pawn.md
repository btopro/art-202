# Save these images to a file on your computer


![](/assets/pawn front back and sides.jpg)

![](/assets/pawn top.jpg)

![](/assets/C_1.jpg)

we are going to open up a new file with a default cube

![](/assets/C_2.jpg)

next we drag in the corresponding pawn images and assign them to the correct perspectives in the background images area

![](/assets/C_3.jpg)

there is no actual bottom and you can drag the side image for the front and back left and right perspectives

![](/assets/C_4.jpg)

once everything is sorted you can minimize tabs to make things easier to see and verify

![](/assets/C_5.jpg)

make sure that you are emulating the numpad on the input tab of the user preferences if you are not using a traditional keyboard

![](/assets/C_6.jpg)

if you are not using a traditional keyboard with a numpad your preferences should look like this

![](/assets/C_7.jpg)

not if you push 5 repeatedly it should toggle between orthographic and two-point perspective views

![](/assets/C_8.jpg)

now if you push the number keys you will orbit into very specific views and so long as you stay in orthographic mode you will see your reference images and your mesh geometry will be align itself to the reference image for the purpose of editing

![](/assets/C_9.jpg)

the next step is to press g to scale the object to the dimension of the reference image

![](/assets/C_10.jpg)

if you press Z for wireframe mode you will see the image through the box

![](/assets/C_11.jpg)

if you look at this from above however the base is too dissimilar to continue when we could instead swap out a the square for a cylinder

![](/assets/C_12.jpg)

we now delete the cube press shift S to bring up a menu select move cursor to center and press shift a to select to insert a cylinder from the mesh category

![](/assets/C_13.jpg)

![](/assets/C_14.jpg)

we can scale the cylinder to the write size using the same method as the square

![](/assets/C_15.jpg)

![](/assets/C_16.jpg)

next we subdivide the cylinder using the menu assigned to the w key and adjusting the number of subdivisions to something larger

![](/assets/C_17.jpg)

be sure to select edges and vertices with a selection tool so that you also get hidden ones then vertically orient your slices to match the pawn reference image

![](/assets/C_18.jpg)

here are some steps as things get spaced

![](/assets/C_19.jpg)

if you switch back and forth between your views you can see how the shape starts to take form

![](/assets/C_20.jpg)

a few more similar steps

![](/assets/C_21.jpg)

I carefully select the vertices and correct for it with the shrink or fatten function

![](/assets/C_21b.jpg)

I happen to have some extra stuff remaining

![](/assets/C_22.jpg)

at this point only the top and bottom need adjustment and this can be done by selecting the rings extruding new points in the immediate location and pressing alt or option and M to merge at center

![](/assets/C_23.jpg)

afterwards it should look something like this

![](/assets/C_24.jpg)

if the bottom is a high-polygon face for now that is fine or use the last-described method

![](/assets/C_25.jpg)

![](/assets/C_26.jpg)

your final object should look something like this
