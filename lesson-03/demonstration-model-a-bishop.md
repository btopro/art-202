for our bishop we are going to start with a cylinder

![](/assets/D_2.jpg)

Press N to bring up the menu with background image management in it

![](/assets/D_3.jpg)

import and manage the bishop files accordingly

![](/assets/D_4.jpg)

Make sure to adjust your input preferences if you do not have a traditional numpad on your keyboard

![](/assets/D_5.jpg)

Use the s button to scale the bishop to the correct size- make sure that you are in orthographic mode

![](/assets/D_6.jpg)

select and edge then select loop and slide- once the cursor has been oriented on the model use the scroll wheel to give yourself several horizontal cuts

![](/assets/D_7.jpg)

use the border selection tool to select and vertically align the horizontal slices to the regions where the most critical changes occur on the object's surface- make more loop cuts casually as needed so as not to flood the viewing plane at first

![](/assets/D_8.jpg)

use the s key to enable scaling- after you select and scale the section cuts horizontally to fit the bishops width make sure that each individual scaling occurs on both the x and y dimensions

![](/assets/D_9.jpg)

carefully make an edgeloop close to the top so that you can merge the top circle using alt or option and m followed by merge to center

![](/assets/D_10.jpg)

after you have successfully merged your top make sure that there are only 4 edge loops bisecting the corners of the Bishops cut- this will make the geometry easier to work with later on

![](/assets/D_11.jpg)

carefully select the vertices making up the interior of the bishop's cut and turn them into a face

![](/assets/D_12.jpg)

Next, extrude the face to creat another connecting face of identical proportions- then enable snapping with to-vertices specified and use g to move the extrusion to opposite end of the cut 

![](/assets/D_13.jpg)

Make sure to constrain your movement accordingly so that the wedge lines up on both axis

![](/assets/D_14.jpg)

carefully select the faces of the four sides of the insert - hold shift and press D to duplicate this form and drag it away and click to place the duplicate

![](/assets/D_15.jpg)

press Shift and D again followed by P - this is how you duplicate an object to its own layer

![](/assets/D_16.jpg)

clean up the extra geometry and floating box from the bishop layer - rename the wedge layer something memorable and insert it back into place on the bishop

![](/assets/D_17.jpg)

selected the object layer that you want to carve into - add a Boolean Modifier - choose the difference setting and select the wedge layer from the entry window- finally hit apply

![](/assets/D_18.jpg)

now clean up the extra vertices edges and faces

![](/assets/D_19.jpg)

what remains is a well-crafted bishop
