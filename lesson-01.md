For this lesson, we are going to have **four demonstrations.** 

The **first** is an improvised demonstration. I specifically go through the process of making a polygonal mess so that I can demonstrate a workflow as I try to turn it into something. This is intended to demonstrate the creative, exploratory possibilities of 3D-Modeling and introduce you to part of the workflow of Blender, without the confines of completing a specific task and opening up the potential for creativity. 

The **second** and **third** demonstrations are to show you how to be creative with simple geometry and make very basic forms. You will be expected to create your own variation of gems and diamonds for review by myself and your peers.

The **fourth** demonstration will show you how to make the first part of a chess-set. The board. You will be expected to closely approximate this model yourself, by following the steps in the this demonstration.
