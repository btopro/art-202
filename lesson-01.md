This is what the blender main screen looks like when you first open it up

![](/assets/A_2.jpg)

If you go to the top of the screen you'll see that there is a menu called File

![](/assets/A_3.jpg)

click on user preferences

![](/assets/A_4 .jpg)

if you are working on a laptopn that does not have a dedicated number pad then select emulate numpad from within the Input Tab

![](/assets/A_5.jpg)

by default the program presents a cube within what is called object mode

![](/assets/A_6.jpg)

Use the indicated drop menu or the tab button to go between object and edit modes

![](/assets/A_7.jpg)
you can use the scrollwheel to zoom in and out

![](/assets/A_8.jpg)

you can use Z button to toggle in and out of wireframe and bounding box modes or use the indicated sub menu

![](/assets/A_9.jpg)

if you push down on the scroll wheel or otherwise known as middle mouse button and drag you can change your orientation or what is also known as orbit

![](/assets/A_10.jpg)

if you press the number keys you will see that they change your perspective to specific views such as top left bottom right front and back

![](/assets/A_11.jpg)

pressing the number five will toggle between two point perspective and orthoganal views more on this later

![](/assets/A_12.jpg)

you can stretch or expand menus and windos by dragging on their dividers

![](/assets/A_13.jpg)
Here you can see that I have expanded the function menu on the left and the modifier and layer menus on the right

![](/assets/A_14.jpg)

you can click and drag out additional windows by clicking on and dragging from the lines in the corners

![](/assets/A_15.jpg)

you can change each partitioned window into a different and specific view type

![](/assets/A_16.jpg)

you can also set up a screen to view from a camera for the purpose of rendering specific angles

![](/assets/A_17.jpg)

by holding down the shift and middle mouse button you can pan your view

![](/assets/A_18.jpg)

by click on the lines in the corner of any view window you can drag it over other windows to collapse them

![](/assets/A_19.jpg)

Expand the modifier menu on the right

![](/assets/A_20.jpg)

If you click on the wrench tab and then on add modifier you can find a list of potential modifiers to chose from

![](/assets/A_21.jpg)

it's important that you familiarize yourself with the various orbiting and panning methods

![](/assets/A_22.jpg)

here we have an example of the default cube in wireframe mode which makes it easier to see through it

![](/assets/A_23.jpg)

these three icons allow you to choose between vertex line and face selection modes

![](/assets/A_24.jpg)

under face mode you can right click on the black squares to select the corresponding faces

![](/assets/A_25.jpg)
if you continue holding the shift button and selecting faces you can select several at a time

![](/assets/A_26.jpg)

you can then perform operations to multiple faces at once, such as extruding them

![](/assets/A_27.jpg)

observer the different behavior between extrude region and extrude individual

![](/assets/A_28.jpg)

pressing "A" will deselect the already selected faces

![](/assets/A_29.jpg)

pressing "A" another additional time will select all faces

![](/assets/A_30a.jpg) 

you can also subdivide the Faces 

![](/assets/A_30.jpg)

subdividing will help you take control over forming your object in finer detail

![](/assets/A_31.jpg)

The line Selection mode lets you take control of your object using line manipulation

![](/assets/A_32.jpg)

vertex mode allows you to select individual vertices

![](/assets/A_33 .jpg)

wireframe makes it much easier to see sometimes, especially when selecting parts of the object behind the immediate faces

![](/assets/A_34.jpg) 

here I use the shrink or fatten function to narrow the gap

![](/assets/A_35.jpg)

after pressing Z to see the frames my object is starting to look like some kind of crystal or ore

![](/assets/A_36.jpg)

If we then audition the image with the subdivision modifier, we can see that it curves a bit more- almost looking like a cashew or peanut

![](/assets/A_37.jpg)

selecting vertices the c-circle or b-marqui selection tools with the wireframe mode makes it easier to quickly grab entire regions

![](/assets/A_38 .jpg)

with the r-rotate tool you can constrain to specific axis by typing an additional x y or z and then moving your mouse or typing a specific angle

![](/assets/A_39.jpg)

next I will return to bounding box mode and remove the subdivision modifier
