we are going to learn about texture now starting with a cube

![](/assets/I_2.jpg)

enter quad view and extrude multiple segments by face

![](/assets/I_3.jpg)

or just make one long extrusion and divide with loop-cuts

![](/assets/I_4.jpg)

loop-cutting makes the most sense

![](/assets/I_5.jpg)

select and scale alternating selections in the following manner

![](/assets/I_6.jpg)

then subdivide by one

![](/assets/I_7.jpg)

create an additional loop-cut

![](/assets/I_8.jpg)

and another

![](/assets/I_9.jpg)

select these vertices

![](/assets/I_10.jpg)

and delete

![](/assets/I_11.jpg)

setup a mirroring modifier so that we are only editing one side to visualize both

![](/assets/I_12.jpg)

enable proportional editing

![](/assets/I_13.jpg)

specify sharp and deform some anttenae

![](/assets/I_14.jpg)

continue to deform your caterpillar's new shape

![](/assets/I_14b.jpg)

mark seams wherever something changes on the surface of the object

![](/assets/I_15.jpg)

extend a face

![](/assets/I_16.jpg)

use reference images like google maps if needed

![](/assets/I_17.jpg)

disable proportional editing when ready

![](/assets/I_18.jpg)

begin extruding the feet using the extrude individual modifier

![](/assets/I_19.jpg)

use combinations of edge selecting and enabling snap
to get the feet to common or desirable lengths

![](/assets/I_20.jpg)

![](/assets/I_21.jpg)

move legs outwards a bit

![](/assets/I_22.jpg)

try using quad view to help decide placement

![](/assets/I_23.jpg)

things are looking intentional

![](/assets/I_24.jpg)

let's add some width

![](/assets/I_25.jpg)

select a vertex where an eye might be and drag it out a little more

![](/assets/I_26.jpg)

lets get ready to add texture

![](/assets/I_27.jpg)

drag in a new window using the top corner of the viewing port and change it into a UV image editor window

![](/assets/I_28.jpg)

press control and e to bring up the edges menu - this is how you can mark seems once the edges have been selected

![](/assets/I_29.jpg)

mark seams wherever something changes dramatically on the object

![](/assets/I_30.jpg)

use the numpad to switch between efficient perspectives

![](/assets/I_31.jpg)

![](/assets/I_32.jpg)

![](/assets/I_33.jpg)

seams displayed in red

![](/assets/I_34.jpg)

create new edge-loops and turn them immediately into seams if needed

![](/assets/I_35.jpg)

it's coming together

![](/assets/I_36.jpg)

![](/assets/I_37.jpg)

![](/assets/I_38.jpg)

![](/assets/I_39.jpg)
