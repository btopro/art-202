the knight start out the same with a cube

![](/assets/F_2.jpg)

use loop-cuts or subdivide the space

![](/assets/F_3.jpg)

split and delete half of the face through so that we can mirror and just work one side

![](/assets/F_4.jpg)

adhere the geometry the form while keeping track of front versus back geometry and reference images

![](/assets/F_5.jpg)

Insert additional loopcuts with restraint when needed

![](/assets/F_5b.jpg)
use few loopcuts but strategically- cross-referencing multiple angles for accuracy

![](/assets/F_6.jpg)

gradually by going back and forth between views the reference points will start to imply the rest of the way to completing the form

![](/assets/F_7.jpg)

concentrate on getting the implied core of the reference images before chiseling further in

If it gets frustrating you can start over

I remember this step

![](/assets/F_10.jpg)

this time let's start with the base

![](/assets/F_11.jpg)

Using a combination of extrude and shrink or fatten we can develop an intuitive structure from the ground-up

![](/assets/F_12.jpg)

try to capture the essence of the geometry with the fewest number of most consistently sized polygons

![](/assets/F_13.jpg)

move around the form and before you know it it will start to come together

![](/assets/F_14.jpg)

after getting the form of the head we can extrude the hair

![](/assets/F_15.jpg)

with some tweaking it will take form

![](/assets/F_16.jpg)

Mirror to complete the other half and double check with subdivsion modifier to enjoy the results of good polygon spacing
